Github hello world tutorial

Hello, this is Michael coding. I'm about to embark in a coding journey to answer the ultimate question, what do you get if you multiply six by nine? On the way I'll write and share as many codes as I can in a wide range of fields including math, physics and data science. Hope you find them useful.
